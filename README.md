# cpp99problems
https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems, but done in C++.  Each problem has to be individually compiled in its respective folder with `make #`.  The compiler I'm using is g++, but others should work for these basic problems.  Let me know if you're curious about any implementations/details in the issues!
